# Why This App Exists

This application was created primarily for educational and exploratory purposes. The main goal is to learn and experiment with various technologies, methodologies, and concepts related to building a review management system for Shopify.

It's important to note that this application is not intended to compete with or replace any existing review management apps. Instead, it serves as a platform for understanding the complexities and challenges involved in building such an application, and for experimenting with potential solutions.

Through the process of building this application, we hope to gain valuable insights and experience that can be applied to future projects and shared with the broader developer community. We believe in the power of learning by doing, and this application is a testament to that belief.
