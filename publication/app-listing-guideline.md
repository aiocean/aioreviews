# Guideline

This is a guideline for Shopify app listing page. It contains everything you need to know about the app, including its features, pricing, and more.

I pasted the content here just for reference.

### A. Basic app information

#### 1\. App name


Your app name is an important part of how you brand yourself to merchants, and how they refer to your app. Follow these requirements when deciding on an app name:

1.  The app name can't include the word "Shopify."
2.  The app name must be 30 characters or fewer.
3.  The app name can't be a generic description of your app's functionality, such as "Banner Slider." Your app name should be short and distinct.
4.  The app name can't end with the name of your Shopify Partner account. For example, your app name can't be "App name by Shopify Partner account name".

#### 2\. App icon

You can add and update your app icon from the app submission form. When making your app icon, follow these guidelines:

1.  Use JPEG or PNG format for the image.
2.  The app icon's dimensions should be 1200px by 1200px.
3.  Don't include text in your app icon.
4.  Don't include screenshots or photographs in your app icon.
5.  Use padding around your app icon. Your logo shouldn't touch the edge of the image.
6.  Keep the corners square. The image's corners are automatically rounded when it's displayed.
7.  Use bold colors and recognizable patterns.
8.  Make it simple and focus on one or two elements. Visual clutter can make an image less effective.
9.  Don't include seasonal promotions in the app icon. For example, you shouldn't promote BFCM discounts in the app icon.

#### 3\. App categorization

When merchants visit the Shopify App Store, they can search for apps by using [categories, subcategories, and tags](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/categories).

The tags impact your store's discoverability on the App Store. In this field, you must select a primary tag that best describes your apps' core functionality. You can add an additional secondary tag if your app has other core functionality that isn't described by the primary tag.

Changes to this field will trigger a review by the Shopify app review team.

If your app capabilities change and you want to change how your app is categorized, then you can submit an appeal to change the app categorization by using the link in the app submission form. After the Shopify app review team completes their review, they'll send a response, whether it's approved or rejected.

#### 4\. Languages

In the **Languages** section of your app listing, you need to enter all the languages in which merchants can use your app’s UI within the Shopify admin. The Shopify admin itself can be used in any [supported languages](https://help.shopify.com/manual/your-account/languages). To learn more about translating your app, refer to [Internationalization](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/best-practices/internationalization).

If any languages listed under the **Languages** section of the app listing aren't available within your app, then you'll be asked to remove them from the list.

### B. App store listing content

Your app store listing content should describe your app's features at a high level. When creating your app store listing content, don't reference your other apps and services in your app store listing content.

#### 1\. Feature media

You must add a feature image or video for the listing header. A feature image or video is a required part of the app listing. It shows merchants more about your app in a highly visible part of your listing.

A short video is the best way to showcase the impact of the app on the business and how customers experience the app. If you don't have a video, then you can use a static image instead.

##### a) Feature video guidelines

A feature video should promote the core features and functionality of your app and how it interacts with Shopify. Merchants want to understand what to expect from your app and how it will help them run their businesses. An effective promotional video will encourage the merchant to take a deeper look through your app listing to learn more about the features that were introduced in the video.

Follow these guidelines when making your feature video:

-   The video should be no longer than 2-3 minutes.
-   Don't include long screencasts of someone using the application. Up to 25% of the video can use screencasts for demoing features, but the video should be promotional, not instructional.
-   Be mindful of any third-party logos or elements that you include in the feature video to avoid potential trademark issues.
-   Choose an eye-catching thumbnail that will make merchants want to watch the video to learn more.

##### b) Feature image guidelines

If you don't have a video, then use a static image to highlight your app. Your image should convey the benefit, functionality, or unique value of your app. For example, the image might show the customer experience on the storefront, or how the merchant's workflow or business results are impacted.

Follow these guidelines when you're preparing your feature image:

-   Use JPEG or PNG format for the image.
-   The image's dimensions must be 1600px by 900px (16:9).
-   Leave a margin of 100px around the outside edges of the image.
-   Provide alt text for your image. This text appears if your image fails to load and can help people who use assistive devices like screen readers. It also helps with search engine optimization.
-   If you're using text in your image:
    -   Localize and translate text for every language that your app listing is available in.
    -   Keep the text short, simple, and scannable for both desktop and mobile devices.
    -   Don't repeat your app card subtitle in the image.
-   Don’t use the Shopify logo in your image.
-   Avoid using heavily patterned or textured background images. Instead, use one or two colors for the background.
-   Ensure that there is enough contrast between the background and any text. A 4.5:1 contrast ratio is recommended.
-   Make your image simple. An image should have a single point of focus, and use only a few elements. Visual clutter can make an image less effective.
-   Avoid using screenshots of your application that contain many small elements or a lot of text. Crop or simplify screenshots where possible.

#### 2\. Demo store URL

Provide a link to a demo store that showcases your app so merchants can see a live demonstration of how the app works. This lets the merchant get a sense of how your app can benefit them.

As a Shopify Partner, you can use a free [development store](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/development-stores) as your demo store. If you use a development store, then the store must be owned by the Partner account that you're submitting your app with.

Follow these guidelines when providing a demo URL:

-   **Use a Shopify store**: Use a Shopify development store, or a live store that you own, rather than a marketing page or video. Merchants want to be able to explore how an app functions in a store.
-   **Thoughtfully design your demo store**: If your demo store is poorly designed, then merchants might negatively associate the design of the store with the quality or aesthetics of your app.
-   **Link to the relevant part of the store**: Consider linking to a page in your demo store that best demonstrates your app's functionality. For example, if your app impacts only the product page of a store, then link directly to a product page.
-   **Provide contextual instructions**: Make it easy for merchants to know exactly what your app is impacting within the demo store. If your app is complex, then add text to the demo store to guide merchants through the experience.

#### 3\. Screenshots

In the **Screenshots** section, you must provide screenshots to show what your user interface looks like in action. Screenshots provide an opportunity to visually share what your app does in the storefront or the Shopify admin.

Follow these guidelines when you're preparing screenshots:

#### a) General screenshot guidelines

-   Provide alt text for all images for accessibility and to improve SEO.
-   Don't use a merchant's personal information without consent in the images. This includes information like store names, phone numbers, and `.myshopify.com` URLs.
-   Add annotations or highlighting to draw attention to important elements, such as any links that your app inserts in the Shopify admin.
-   If you add text annotations, then localize and translate the text for every language that your app listing is available in.

#### b) Desktop screenshot guidelines

-   Each screenshot's dimensions should be 1600px by 900px (16:9) for desktop.
-   Include between 3-6 screenshots of your app on desktop.
-   Include at least one screenshot of your app's user interface.
-   Provide alt text for all images for accessibility and to improve SEO.
-   Don't include desktop backgrounds and browser windows in your screenshots. Crop them so your images aren't cluttered and don't distract merchants from your app.
-   If your app is embedded, then don't include sensitive information such as the store name or any user information. You can include the left-hand navigation.

#### c) Mobile screenshot guidelines

-   Each screenshot's dimensions should be 1600px by 900px (16:9).
-   If your app is mobile responsive on the storefront, then include screenshots that show your app's mobile functionality. This helps merchants visualize how your app will look to a customer on their storefront.
-   Your mobile screenshots shouldn't be duplicates of your desktop screenshots. This means they must display the responsiveness of your user interface when viewed on a mobile device.

#### d) Point of sale screenshot guidelines

-   Each screenshot's dimensions should be 1600px by 900px (16:9).
-   If your app is for Shopify Point of Sale or has features that work with it, then you must include a screenshot showing this. This helps merchants specifically looking for point of sale apps understand that yours integrates with it.

#### 4\. App introduction

The app introduction field gives you 100 characters to explain your app's purpose and main benefit to merchants. The app introduction appears as prominently displayed text on your app store listing.

Follow these guidelines when writing your app introduction:

-   Clearly highlight the benefits that merchants can expect from your app. For example, "\[App Name\] makes personalized advertising campaigns simple, and helps you find new customers."
-   Don't add keywords to the app introduction with the intent of improving search performance.
-   Don't use personal merchant information without consent from the merchant.
-   Don't include data or statistics. You can feel free to share this information on your website and landing pages.

The following table shows some good examples and bad examples of app introductions:

| Do                                                                                                 | Don't                                                                                                       | Reason                                                                                                                         |

#### 5\. App details


The app details field gives you 500 characters to expand on your app's main benefits. In this field, you should let the merchant know what makes your app unique. The app details should be concise, but informative.

Follow these guidelines when writing your app details:

-   Focus on functional elements of your app in your app details, and avoid excessive marketing language.
-   Don't only list features in the app details. Use the [Feature list](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/requirements#5-app-listing#feature-list) field for listing features instead.
-   Don't include support information such as emails and phone numbers in the app details. Use the [Support](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/requirements#5-app-listing#3-sales-and-support) fields to enter your support information instead.
-   Don't include links and URLs in the app details. The submission form lets you provide links to your [website's homepage](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/requirements#5-app-listing#developer-website-url), your [FAQ page](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/requirements#5-app-listing#faq-url), and your [pricing information](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/requirements#5-app-listing#d-pricing), where you can host whatever additional information.
-   Don't include testimonials in the app details.
-   Don't add keywords to the app details with the intent of improving search performance.
-   Don't include any data or statistics in your app details. Feel free to share this information on your website and landing pages.

#### 6\. Feature list

The feature list should include a list of the functional features of your app. The content for each listed feature should be short so that merchants can easily scan the list to understand what your app offers. You can use up to 80 characters per feature.

When writing your feature list, you should describe the functionality, not the mechanics behind each feature. The following table shows some good examples and bad examples for features:

| Do                                                                             | Don't                                                                                                           | Reason                                                                                                        |

Avoid keyword stuffing and incomplete sentences.                         |

#### 7\. Integrations

The **Integrations** field lets you list a maximum of six integrations. If your app has more than six integrations, then list the ones that merchants will be most interested in.

Don't include the following in your list of supported integrations:

1.  Shopify
2.  other shopping carts, unless you provide synchronization or cross-platform compatibility
3.  other apps in the Shopify App Store, unless your app directly integrates with them

### C. Resources

#### Privacy policy URL (Required)

[Data and user privacy](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/store/data-protection/protected-customer-data) are extremely important to merchants, and they value Partners who take security seriously. You need to include a privacy policy for your app.

#### Developer website URL (Optional)

Having a website that gives more information about your app can help merchants to decide if they want to install it. This URL needs to be set to the landing page of your developer website. If the URL goes to a special promotional page, then you'll be asked to change it.

#### FAQ URL (Optional)

This is a great opportunity to answer frequently asked questions in detail to merchants. This URL must redirect the merchant to a dedicated FAQ page on your website. If the URL redirects to a cloud document or PDF, then you'll be asked to change it.

#### Changelog URL (Optional)

A changelog is a great way to show merchants what's new with your app, and show that you're actively supporting and updating your app. The URL must redirect the merchant to a dedicated changelog page on your website.

#### Support portal URL (Optional)

You can provide a link directly to your support portal to give merchants a more complete view of the support services that you offer.

#### Tutorial URL (Optional)

In order to set merchants up for success, you can provide a link to a relevant tutorial or other onboarding guidance.

#### Additional app documentation (Optional)

In this field, you can provide a link to any other additional documentation that would be helpful and relevant to merchants using your app.
